Overall project idea is discussed here
#
this idea is based on python-machine-learning information.
#
some information from the tutorials - to plan the programm:
# input data:
links, some format can be made to unifiy the input http[s]:\\ etc. it will be from tutorial
#
The links can be divided in some way - the criteria is in makreting.
#
Model should predict which links can be "good" and other shall be irrelevant.
# learning:
Internet markering: Assesment of a link is a phase wheere the consumer knows if the link is ok and worhty of viewing. 
#
The programm AI will help to create a model for checking links if they are ok.
# structure of data for nat. language recognition:
# etc.
