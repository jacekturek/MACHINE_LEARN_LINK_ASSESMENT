Models of develpoment:
1) for the code and software system - spiral model = prototyping is important to check the work if it's in the right direction
2) for the analysis of python machine learning - waterfal model = check the relevant knowledge
2a) if the project is appliable to this and how it will develop
2b) WATERFALL: About the general process - About input - About processing and meaning
2c) 2 is generalization of the concept presented in the initial README.md
