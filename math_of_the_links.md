See README.MD first

# The sets

> The intersection of the sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of elements that belong to both A and B (tutorial)

The links cannot be GOOD and NOT GOOD as well - the sets must be 'unique'

> The complement of a set A, denoted by AC is the set of all the elements except the elements in A.

And all links can be defined as two sets, A+B = all links (good and the rest).
