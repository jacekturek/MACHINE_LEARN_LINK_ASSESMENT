# The sets

> The intersection of the sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of elements that belong to both A and B (tutorial)

The links cannot be GOOD and NOT GOOD as well - the sets must be 'unique'

> The complement of a set A, denoted by A^C is the set of all the elements except the elements in A.

All links can be defined as two sets, A+B = all links (good and the rest).

> Groups: (ALinks, concatenation), links concatenation belongs to ALinks

In theory two links which are good should form a good link - as well as the other set.

> Identity element (in the Group)

It's an empty string: ""

> Only the property of closure holds, thus the group is a Mathematical Structure: Group (only).

e.g. link1 + link2 != link2 + link1
