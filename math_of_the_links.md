# The concept

See README.MD first

# The sets

> ☛ The intersection of the sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of elements that belong to both A and B (tutorial)

The links cannot be GOOD and NOT GOOD as well - the sets must be 'unique'

> ☛ The complement of a set A, denoted by A^C is the set of all the elements except the elements in A.

All links can be defined as two sets, A+B = all links (good and the rest).

# The groups

> ☛ Groups: (ALinks, concatenation), links concatenation belongs to ALinks

In theory two links which are good should form a good link - as well as the other set.

> Identity element (in the Group)

It's an empty string: ""

> it is that closure hods, it's associative, and has and identity element

> ☛ such a group is Monoid

exapmles of such a group are integer numbers with multiplication, real numbers with addition

# The functions

With a fuction f(link) -> {good, bad} it is easy to show what kind of transformation is good.

> This is an "onto" relation, which is irreversible since good can mean many links.

# The sets

> links are not naturally ordered in this case they are a set (not a series)

> ☛ A set of vertices I is called independent set if no two vertices in set I are adjacent to each other (tutorial)

In theory good and bad links are not adjacent (*see any graph*).

> ☛ it's a '*stable set*'
