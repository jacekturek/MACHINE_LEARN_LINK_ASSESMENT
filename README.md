# MACHINE_LEARN_LINK_ASSESMENT
Link assesment for myself / Version 1.0 beta.
Version 2.0 also beta should have a web-harvester included.
#
The program will asses a link whether is OK (crit mine) or NOT
the crit later.
#
Criteria is mine but good.
INTERESTING: http[s]//::iamgreat.com.pl
NOT-INTERESTING http[s]//::ilikeit.com
#
game theor: links may not be classifed into these criteria hence INTREST = GOOD / NOT-INTD = NOT-GOOD; fot this programm. Maybe it's better.
#
=> AI for marketing... automating business criteria, searching, evaluation
#
Model od dev: SPIRAL by prototypes
1.st python machine leraning if it works

#
Labeled data - to predict:
[http[s]://aaaa.bbbb.ccc.ddd [INTERESTING | NOT INTERESTING]
#

? LINEAR REGRESSION is separating links interesint / not interesting
probability or something like this for myself: max possible?

#
Links are a good set /structral errors - excluded/
#
Knowledge is provided by me in the way the LINK is classified into "INTERESTING" category (marketing).
#
Some regression is possible.
#
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI). /undesrtanding humans speech/.
e.g. Gmail uses natural language processing (NLP) to discern which emails are legitimate and which are spam.
#
Regression could be established between good/not good - expect 2 groups of links.
#
In mu opition X = good links in searching machine create the M(m,s), hence I want 300 links to find the one interested (roughly).
#ABC
