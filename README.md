# MACHINE_LEARN_LINK_ASSESMENT
Link assesment for myself / Version 1.0 beta.
Version 2.0 also beta should have a web-harvester included for getting input links.
#
The marketing criteria for links is based on the PRODUCT / 4P and Marketing 5.0
- the AI can measure behaviour (human)
- for the AI it can be rewritten: LINK OK | OTHER
- this is for teaching the system

IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO:
- the tutorial is imporrtant to plan activites (tutorial in other pages / will be mentioned)
- the data shall be able to be divided
- based on the language processing
- the information within a link is the bascics for marketing
- this is one of the first stages to asses the page
- the impression after viewing the page is based on different criterion / doesn't correspond the link classification
- the continuation can be assessment of the web site (promotion / 4p) and further costomer satisfaction assesment (product / 4p)

Finally some regression shoul appear in the end separaring links in 2 grups.
Marketing and AI: speech python recognition, in term of understanding a link.
This can be considered some AI marketing (next steps in this are allways possible).
