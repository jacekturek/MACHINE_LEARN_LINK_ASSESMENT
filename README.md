Criteria, for now:

LINK (marketing 5.0):
a) good
b) other 

Definition: 
LINKS = GOOD = LINKS THAT I WANT
LINKS = BAD = LINKS THAT I DON'T WANT

Choose a programming language: Python is a popular choice for ML.
Python machine learning is available and will be used here.

Finally some regression shoul appear in the end separaring links in 2 grups.
Marketing and AI: speech python recognition, in term of understanding a link.
This can be considered some AI marketing (next steps in this are allways possible).
